## Data used to train segmenting models

I used NIfTI files from the [BraTS2020 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation) on Kaggle to train my semantic image segmentation models. I took the 

## Convolutional Neural Networks Trained
Currently, I have trained only one neural network that segments brain MRI scans.
