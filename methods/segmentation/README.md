# Data used to train segmenting models

I used jpeg files from the Kaggle dataset [Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) to train my models. I took the 

# Convolutional Neural Networks Trained
Currently, I have trained only one neural network that segments brain MRI scans.
